## IFS

Deterministic IFS fractals. Transformations are in the form

```{a, b, c, d, e, f}```

using the formula, where ```x``` and ```y``` are the coordinates for the new point.

```x = ax + by + e, y = cx + dy + f```

The IFS are created through ```genIFS```. You can customize ```iter``` for number of iterations. They are printed through ```printIFS```. ```x``` and ```y``` are the print coordinates, and ```multX``` and ```multY``` are the multipliers for each of coordinate. A number of curve presets are availible, taken from [here](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/ifs/), which you can use by simply pasting the macro.

## Potential Additions
- [ ] Turning and angles
- [ ] More display customization
