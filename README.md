<h1 align="center">Commandline Visuals</h1>

<p align="center">Simple commandline visualizations using C99 through VT100 escape sequences, which Windows 10 recently started supporting. Each folder contains a README.md file with a short description of the program. Each program can be easily customized. No external libraries are needed; the only non-standard library used is windows.h. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Note</b> : If you are using cl.exe, you can also run <code>compile.bat</code> to compile all of them into a <code>Programs</code> folder by specifying the path to your developer command prompt in <code>path[cl]</code></p>
