# CommandlineMazes
Simple maze generator/solver based on recursive backtracking in C99. Uses VT100 escape sequences as display. This is more of a proof of concept to visualize things using escape sequences, which Windows recently started supporting.

Includes "themes" that can change the characters displayed. Current themes are default (|, _ ,  ) future (|, _ ,  ), and surreal (@, ?, %).

## Potential things to add
- [ ] Add more maze algorithms
- [ ] More display customization
