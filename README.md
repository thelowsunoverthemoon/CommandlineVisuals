# Commandline Visuals

Simple commandline visualizations using C99 through VT100 escape sequences, which Windows 10 recently started supporting. Each folder contains a desc.md file with a short description of the program. Each program can be easily customized. No external libraries are needed; the only non-standard library used is windows.h.
